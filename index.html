          <h3>PayPal enables transfer of digital currencies to external wallets</h3>
          <p>The move comes after nearly two years since PayPal enabled users to buy and sell crypto on its platform.

          <p>
            After
            rolling out the ability to buy and sell crypto on its platform in October 2020, PayPal is finally allowing
            users the ability to natively transfer, send and receive digital assets between PayPal and other wallets and
            exchanges. As of Tuesday, the feature is available to select U.S. users, with the feature expanding to all
            eligible U.S. users in the coming weeks. The first batch of supported coins consists of Bitcoin
            BTC $16,704, Ether ETH $1,217, Bitcoin Cash BCH $100, and Litecoin LTC $74.58.
            In addition, customers who transfer their crypto onto PayPal can spend it via Checkout at millions of
            merchant
            terminals. The company has been granted a full Bitlicense by the New York Department of Financial Services
            for
            the conduct.

          <h3>Italian Parliament Approves 26% Crypto-Gains Tax in 2023 Budget</h3>
          <p>Italian Parliament Approves 26% Crypto-Gains Tax in 2023 Budget

          <p>
            Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni's new bill also includes an incentive for those declaring crypto for tax
            purposes.
            Crypto traders in Italy will be subject to a 26% capital-gains tax starting in 2023, according to a new
            budget
            that won parliamentary approval on Thursday.
            Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni's 2023 expansionary budget – which was completed in a rush before the
            end of the year – features 21 billion euros ($22.3 billion) in tax breaks to assist businesses and
            households
            facing the energy crisis, Reuters reported.
            In Italy, where crypto remains largely unregulated, the 387-page budget legitimizes crypto assets by
            defining
            them as "a digital representation of value or rights, which can be transferred and stored electronically,
            using the technology of distributed ledger or similar technology."
            Italy's (and most recently Portugal's) move to introduce a capital-gains tax on crypto comes ahead of the
            implementation of the European Union's Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulation that promises a licensing
            frameworks and stringent operating requirements for crypto-service providers in the 27-member bloc.
            The 26% rate applies to gains from crypto trading if they exceed 2,000 euros per tax period. As an incentive
            for declaring crypto profits, the new bill also sets a "substitute income tax" for investors at 14% of the
            value of the assets held as of Jan. 1, 2023, instead of the cost at the time of purchase.
            According to the new rules, losses from crypto investments can be deducted from profits and be carried
            forward.
            Investors, however, may require some additional guidance on what qualifies as a taxable event as the
            document
            also says, "the exchange between crypto assets having same characteristics and functions," doesn't
            constitute
            a "fiscal case."

            Microstrategy Buys More Bitcoin — Company's Crypto Holdings Grow to 132,500 BTC
          </h3>
          <p>Microstrategy Buys More Bitcoin — Company's Crypto Holdings Grow to 132,500 BTC
          </p>
          <img src="news3.png" alt="Image not found" />
          <p>
            Microstrategy is now holding approximately 132,500 bitcoin following its most recent purchases. This year,
            the
            world’s largest cryptocurrency has emerged as “the institutional-grade digital asset,” said Microstrategy
            founder Michael Saylor.

            Microstrategy Acquires More Bitcoin
            Nasdaq-listed Microstrategy Inc. announced Wednesday that it has purchased more bitcoin for its corporate
            treasury. Michael Saylor, the company’s founder and executive chairman, tweeted Wednesday:
            Microstrategy has increased its bitcoin holdings by ~2,500 BTC. As of 12/27/22 Microstrategy holds ~132,500
            bitcoin acquired for ~$4.03 billion at an average price of ~$30,397 per bitcoin.
            In its filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Microstrategy clarified that the 2,500
            coins were acquired between Nov. 1 and Dec. 24 by its wholly owned subsidiary Macrostrategy.
            The subsidiary bought approximately 2,395 BTC at an average price of $17,871 per coin between Nov. 1 and
            Dec.
            21. It then sold about 704 BTC at $16,776 per coin on Dec. 22. Macrostrategy then bought about 810 more BTC
            at
            $16,845 per coin on Dec. 24. At the time of writing, bitcoin is trading at $16,656.80.
            The bitcoin sale in December marked the first time Microstrategy sold its bitcoin since it began
            accumulating
            the crypto for its corporate treasury in 2020. The company cited tax reasons for selling BTC. “Microstrategy
            plans to carry back the capital losses resulting from this transaction against previous capital gains, to
            the
            extent such carrybacks are available under the federal income tax laws currently in effect, which may
            generate
            a tax benefit,” the SEC filing describes.
            Saylor said in an interview last week:

            <h3>
              Bitcoin Miners’ Revenue Hits $9.55 Billion in 2022
            </h3>
            <p>2022 has been a rough and tough year for investors, traders, cryptocurrency businesses, and miners in
              general. The prolonged bear market, exacerbated by a series of catastrophic events, posed a threat to
              miners.
            </p>
            <img src="news4.png" alt="Image not found" />
            <p>Miners were dealing with a variety of issues, including defaulted loans, quarterly losses, and soaring
              bitcoin hashrates that reached all-time highs. All these factors were affecting the profitability of the
              miners and were causing sell pressure.
              The situation was aggravated when cryptocurrency prices, including Bitcoin’s, plummeted. Bitcoin, which
              was
              hovering around $48,000 last year, hit a low of $15,590 by the end of 2022. According to the data
              collected
              from The Block, bitcoin miners’ revenue hit $9.55 billion in 2022.
              Bitcoin miners’ revenue dropped in 2022
              Bitcoin, which is trading at $16,721 at press time, has been on a downward spiral alongside other
              cryptocurrencies. The falling cryptocurrency prices had a major effect on the income and profits of
              miners.
              Even though the $9.55 billion in revenue in 2022 seems like a large number, it is comparatively lower than
              that of 2021.

              Over the course of 2021, bitcoin miners made more than $15 billion in revenue, according to the data from
              the
              block. This was actually considered to be a 206% year-over-year increase.

            <h3>
              Mango Markets Exploiter Eisenberg Arrested in Puerto Rico
            </h3>
            <p>The investor drained $110 million in cryptocurrencies from the platform.
            </p>
            <img src="news5.png" alt="Image not found" />
            <p>
              Avraham Eisenberg, the crypto investor whose “highly profitable trading strategy” drained DeFi trading
              platform Mango Markets of crypto worth $110 million, was arrested Monday in Puerto Rico, court documents
              said.
              The self-described game theorist admitted his role in draining Mango Markets’ treasury shortly after the
              incident in mid-October, and may now be the first U.S. resident to face charges for his role in
              manipulating
              a decentralized-finance trading platform.
              Eisenberg faces charges of commodities fraud and commodities manipulation, according to a filing unsealed
              Tuesday. The charges could see punishments ranging from fines to prison time.
              A deposition signed by FBI Special Agent Brandon Racz alleges Eisenberg “willfully and knowingly”
              manipulated the sale of a commodity – namely futures contracts on Mango Markets.
              “Eisenberg engaged in a scheme involving the intentional and artificial manipulation of the price of
              perpetual futures contracts on a cryptocurrency exchange called Mango Markets, and other manipulative and
              deceptive devices and contrivances.”
